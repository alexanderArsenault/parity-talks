DESKTOP + MOBILE
- Bigger space at the bottom of each page (at least about double of what it is now).

>>>WILL DO

- Hover for links is missing (Partners on INFO, Supporters etc on GROUP). 

>>>GO GREY ON HOVER?
>>>ANY MOBILE IDEAS?

- Firefox doesn’t let me see the twitch link but I think that’s my privacy settings

>>>WILL DO

- How do we get to the live stream / TALKS landing site? There’s three options: clicking WHAT’S GOOD, the DATE of the event, and the little live toggle. I would make What’s Good not clickable, as it^s essentially just leading to the live stream, which can be confusing, but link the DATE of the event to the livestream (and the live toggle on mobile). When on live stream the DATE is black. When no livestream is happening, a blank WHAT’S GOOD page is used as landing page (which will be fine bc eventually there will be the interaction element there). 

>>>LINK DATE TO stream, BLACK WHEN ON stream, HOME WHEN ACTIVE
>>>LINK LIVE TO stream
>>>WHATS GOOD NOT CLICKABLE WHEN EVENT LIVE, WHATSGOOD HOME WITH GRAPHIC IN FUTURE



DESKTOP ONLY
-Season: align offline bar with the bottom of the menu so it looks like the folder tab in mobile version when scrolling down
>>>COMPLETED?

MOBILE ONLY
- TALKS: «Info» Title should be left aligned
>>COMPLETED

- Live Button on top needs to be on every page (and clickable?)
- Line height PARITY -> TALKS/SEASON/GROUP a bit smaller
- When I press any link or dropdown, the div block (or just a rectangle around it) shortly turns black. can we remove this?
- Is the little MENU on top left really useful/needed? I happened to click intuitively a few times on PARITY TALKS/SEASON/etc to get to the menu. 
- SEASON: Online/Offline in small font. 
- SEAON: YEAR: Titles all same size. 
- SEAON: Columns in Dropdown are not always the same. Time/date is sometimes too cramped on one side (maybe this is bc you’re currently changing it)
